1. Download intellij
2. Go to the gitlab and clone the repository using:
      git init .
      git clone <SSH Clone>
3. Then we enter intelliJ and we make sure to select Maven when opening the project and we will find out that dependencies are been installed automatically.
4. We will go to the main application and we will see red lines. This is because JDK is not installed. when JDK is installed, they will disappear.
  To do this, go to FILE > Project Structure
5. Then we install JDK using terminal on linux or website on windows. JDK installed should be JDK 15
   however for linux terminal, since we cannot run the install command directly, then we use the following commands to first check the versions available, then we install.
       java --version
       sudo apt install openjdk-13-jre-headless
6. Check viddeo by Nana to see how she made the file appear in documents so it can be slected when choosing an SDK.
7. When it is done you will see green triangles on the application file and if you click it, it will run the app.
8. Then we have to install maven to build the app using:
        sudo apt install maven
9. Then we navigate to the app file and then run the build command:
        mvn package
